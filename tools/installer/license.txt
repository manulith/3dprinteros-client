Your order may have additional terms that apply to the particular services in your order. When using the term “Agreement” in any of the order, 3DprinterOS services, privacy policy or other terms we are referring collectively to all of them, including any product specific terms that apply to the Services.

YOUR FILES & YOUR PRIVACY
By using our Services you provide us with information and files that you submit to 3DprinterOS (“files”). You retain full ownership to your files. We do not claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your files or intellectual property. Some limitations may apply to run the Services and these are explained below
We may need your permission to perform certain operations with your files, such as hosting your files or sharing them at your direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example, file thumbnails or previews. It includes technical administration of our Services, for example, how we backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to perform those things solely to provide the Services. This permission applies also to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example, storage providers to provide the Services.
3DprinterOS does not share your content with others, for any purpose including law enforcement, unless you direct us to. In our Privacy Policy below we explain how we collect and use your information generally.
You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and your communications with others while using the Services, including sharing of your files. It is your responsibility to ensure you have the rights or permission necessary to comply with these Terms.
You acknowledge that 3DprinterOS has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the functionality, printability, quality, accuracy or legality of files or any other information you share or may be able to access using the Services.
SHARING YOUR FILES
Our Services have features that allow you to share your files with others. These features include, for example, printer and file sharing, monitoring of your printer and file activity, also by others if you allow it. Please consider carefully with whom you share printers and files. 3DprinterOS has no responsibility of your choices and activity. 3DprinterOS assumes no responsibility for the quality of any of the uploaded files.
When you upload files (g-codes or stl files) to Services, we may analyze the files to be able to display the correct printing requirements and settings to you and to the file recipient as specified by the creator of the file. These settings help you and the recipient to determine that the destination printer is, in principle and technically, able to print the file. If you are the recipient of a file, you must read the shown settings, verify their suitability for the intended printer and accept the Terms before initiating printing. The settings may or may not be accurate and must not used as the sole method of verifying that the file is printable by the intended printer. 3DprinterOS assumes no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy of the analyzed and displayed settings and provides this feature “as is” without any guarantees of quality, accuracy or reliability.
STORING YOUR FILES
You acknowledge that the Services are primarily a 3D printing, sharing and collaboration service. The Services are not to be used as your sole data storage or backup service. You are, for example, not able to download stored Files from Services, only delete or update Files. This is for improving the security and privacy of your Files. You acknowledge that you must keep other copies of your Files stored elsewhere, outside of the Services, locally or in other services. 3DprinterOS does not print or use your Files for other purposes than those directed by you.
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights of others. Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the right to do so. You, not 3DprinterOS, will be fully responsible and liable for what you upload, copy, share, stream, print or otherwise use while using the Services. You must not upload spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.
You, and not 3DprinterOS, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your files. 3DprinterOS will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your files, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your files.
If your contact information, or other information related to your account, changes, you must notify us promptly and keep your information current. The Services are not intended for use by you if you are under 13 years of age. By agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over 13.
DISCLAIMER ABOUT SENDING PRINT JOBS TO REMOTE 3D PRINTERS
3DprinterOS assumes no liabilities or responsibilities arising from remote 3D printing on manned or unmanned, attended or unattended 3D printers using the Services. Printing on unattended printers, whether your own or a 3D printer shared to you, happens at your own risk. There may be technical malfunctions in the destination 3D printer that can lead to unsuccessful prints or damages to the 3D printer. This includes but is not limited to unsuccessful prints, bad quality prints, damages to the 3D printer (e.g. from initiating a new print job on a 3D printer that has a previous print job still on the print tray). If there is a remote visual observation feature (e.g. web camera) available in the Services for remote visual observation of ongoing printing, we strongly recommend using such connection and feature. Such feature is not a guarantee of quality or successful printing and may malfunction or be unreliable. Do not use such feature as a sole method of verifying that a 3D printer is functional, operational and available. Such feature is provided “as is” without any guarantee of continuous service, reliability or quality.

This Privacy Policy explains the policies of 3DprinterOS regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. As we update and expand our services, this policy may change. By accessing our website, you consent to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
There are a few situations in which we may collect your personal information. For example: When you interact with 3DprinterOS Services, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and IP address. We do not track your other activity on the Internet outside of the Services, or your 3D printing outside of the Services.

Your files are yours, we do not download or use your Files.
3DprinterOS will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the personal information in advance and giving you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being shared.
3DprinterOS also reserves the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety. In the event that 3DprinterOS is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, to sell or otherwise transfer the personal information we have collected as part of that transaction provided that such third party continues to honor our Privacy Policy.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
